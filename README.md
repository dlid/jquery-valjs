0.1 - My "old" version called Johnny5. Don't use it. It's horrible....

### History

I began writing this library in the end of 2013 when I was in need of validating a single part of a form which resulted in the creation of of the library I called Johnny5. It does what I wanted it to at the time, but it was far from the working jQuery plugin that I wanted to create and it fails quickly when you start testing different options.

Now, after almost a year without having the time to actually create a working library I got the opportunity to finish my idea through my studies. During this year, the one thing I've kept thinking about is the name of the library - and I've renamed it to ValJS.

### Tech

ValJS requires the following libraries to work.

* [jQuery] >= V1.7

### Getting started

You need to include jQuery and ValJS

```sh
<script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="js/jquery.valjs.js"></script>
```

You need a HTML form - and yes, ValJS will recognize HTML5 field types such as 'email':

```sh
<form id="myform">

 <label for="email">E-mail:</label>
 <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />

 <div>
  <input type="submit" />
 </div>
</form>
```

Then you need to trigger ValJS for the form:

```sh
<script>
 $(function() {
  $('#myform').valjs();
 });
</script>
```
